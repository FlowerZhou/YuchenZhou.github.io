  I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/"><strong>Purdue University</strong></a>, advised by <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/chjung/"><strong>Prof. Changhee Jung</strong></a>.

  Before that, I received my Master's degree from <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn/"><strong>Peking University</strong></a>, advised by <a href="https://cs.pku.edu.cn/info/1235/2118.htm"><strong>Prof. Xianhua Liu</strong></a> at <a href="https://cs.pku.edu.cn/info/1165/1840.htm"><strong>MPRC</strong></a>, and my Bachelor's degree from <a href="https://en.dlut.edu.cn/"><strong>Dalian University of Technology</strong></a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  My research focuses on providing <strong>reliable and high-performance systems</strong> across embedded platforms, server-class CPUs, and GPUs. I pursue these goals through compiler–architecture co-design, aiming to maximize performance while minimizing hardware overhead.

  As part of this journey, I have explored cutting-edge architectures like <strong>CXL</strong> for server-class CPUs and GPUs to better understand their performance potential. 
  </p>

  <p>
  More recently, I am also interested in applying machine learning to energy-harvesting systems in ways that are both energy-efficient and reasonable, with the goal of designing smarter, more sustainable systems.
