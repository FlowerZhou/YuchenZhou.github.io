  <p>
   I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Purdue University, advised by Professor Changhee Jung. My research focuses on providing crash consistency on diverse platforms, including embedded systems, server-class CPUs, and GPUs. I pursue this goal through compilerâ€“architecture co-design, with an emphasis on maximizing performance while minimizing hardware overhead.
